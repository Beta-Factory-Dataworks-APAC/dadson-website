The official website for Dadson Logistics, featuring company information, services, and a blog functionality powered by PayloadCMS.

## üìã Project Structure

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 application with React 19
- **Blog CMS**: PayloadCMS running as a separate service
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing blog content

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm/pnpm
- MongoDB (Community Edition)
- Git

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd dadson-website
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Environment Configuration**

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root with:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYLOAD_URL=http://localhost:3004
```

4. **Set up MongoDB**

Ensure MongoDB is installed and running:

```bash
# macOS (with Homebrew)
brew services start mongodb/brew/mongodb-community

# Check status
brew services list | grep mongodb
```

5. **Set up PayloadCMS**

The PayloadCMS installation is in the `/payload/dadson-blog` directory:

```bash
cd payload/dadson-blog
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `/payload/dadson-blog` directory:

```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost/dadson-blog
PAYLOAD_SECRET=yoursecretrandomkey
PAYLOAD_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3004
```

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Development

### Quick Start

Run the full stack (Next.js + PayloadCMS) with:

```bash
npm run dev:blog
```

This will:
- Start MongoDB if not running (macOS only)
- Launch PayloadCMS on port 3004
- Start the Next.js app on port 3003

### Individual Components

**Start Next.js Only**
```bash
npm run dev
# or with specific port
npm run dev -- -p 3003
```

**Start PayloadCMS Only**
```bash
npm run dev:cms
```

**Check CMS Environment**
```bash
npm run dev:cms-check
```

### Accessing the Applications
