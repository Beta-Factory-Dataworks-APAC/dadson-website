## Issues Found

| Issue | Severity | Description | Suggested Fix |
|-------|----------|-------------|--------------|
| PayloadCMS not starting | High | PayloadCMS server fails to start with error: `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '{'`. After adding "type": "module", now getting bundler error: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'build')` | Need comprehensive PayloadCMS configuration review and fix. May need to reinstall or adjust how PayloadCMS is initialized |
| Next.js SearchParams error | Medium | Warning about synchronous access to searchParams | Fixed by properly typing and accessing searchParams in blog page components |
| API Connection Errors | High | Frontend cannot connect to PayloadCMS API | Dependent on fixing PayloadCMS startup issues |
| Mock API fallback partially working | Medium | Mock API routes are working but not integrated with frontend | Ensure frontend properly handles API failure cases |

## Completed Fixes

1. ✅ Updated blog page components to use proper typing for searchParams and params
2. ✅ Added "type": "module" to PayloadCMS package.json (but led to new bundler issue)
3. ✅ Tested and verified that mock API endpoints are functioning correctly

## Remaining Tasks

1. Fix PayloadCMS bundler issues and complete setup
2. Test PayloadCMS admin functionality
3. Test integration between Next.js frontend and PayloadCMS API
4. Complete UI testing for all blog components
5. Fix any remaining issues found during testing
6. Finalize documentation with complete setup and testing instructions

## Conclusion

The blog functionality is partially working with mock data but several critical issues remain, primarily with the PayloadCMS setup. The Next.js frontend is correctly configured to handle the blog pages and properly accesses the query parameters.

The mock API infrastructure works correctly and the fallback mechanism is in place, but comprehensive testing is blocked by PayloadCMS configuration issues.

### Next Steps:
1. Focus on resolving PayloadCMS bundler and configuration issues
2. Consider reinstalling PayloadCMS with correct dependencies if needed
3. Continue testing the frontend components with mock data
4. Update the blog module documentation with configuration fixes
5. Complete comprehensive testing once all components are working
