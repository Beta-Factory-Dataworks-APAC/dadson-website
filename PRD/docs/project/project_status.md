## Animation System Implementation Status

As of [Current Date], we have implemented a compatibility layer for animations that will allow easy migration from Framer Motion to React Bits in the future:

1. **Current Implementation**: 
   - A compatibility layer using `AnimationWrapper.tsx` serves as an abstraction over Framer Motion
   - This ensures consistent animation patterns across the site
   - Framer Motion is used temporarily while preparing for React Bits migration

2. **Reusable Animation Components**:
   - `AnimatedHeading`: A component for animating headings with various styles
   - `AnimatedSection`: A wrapper component for applying animations to any content section

3. **Supported Animation Types**:
   - Fade: Simple fade-in effect
   - Slide: Directional slide animations (up, down, left, right)
   - Zoom: Scale animations for emphasis
   - Bounce: Spring-physics based bouncy animations
   - Carousel: Specialized animation for carousels (implementation in progress)

4. **React Bits Migration Plan**:
   - Explore ReactBits.dev documentation to identify equivalent components
   - Use jsrepo CLI to install individual React Bits components
   - Gradually replace Framer Motion implementations in AnimationWrapper
   - Maintain the same API to ensure backwards compatibility

5. **Implementation Status**:
   - Basic animation components created and working
   - Demo page available at `/animation-demo`
   - Implementation of animations on Contact page in progress
   - Framer Motion successfully loaded as a temporary dependency

## Contact Page Implementation Status

The Contact page implementation is currently in progress with the following completed:
- Animation system setup and working
- Font loading verified and working correctly
- TailwindCSS Typography plugin installed

Next steps:
1. Implement Contact form layout
2. Add animations to form elements
3. Implement form validation
4. Connect form to SendGrid for email delivery

## Known Issues

1. **React Bits Implementation**: Currently using Framer Motion as a temporary replacement
2. **Version Conflicts**: React 19 has compatibility issues with some Sanity.io packages
   - Workaround: Using --legacy-peer-deps during installation

## Next Steps

1. Complete Contact page implementation with animations
2. Begin implementing React Bits components using jsrepo CLI
3. Continue with Home page implementation
4. Update documentation with React Bits usage examples
