# Blog Optimization Task

## Objective
Optimize the Dadson Logistics website's blog functionality to ensure it is fully integrated, accessible, and functioning correctly with both mock data and PayloadCMS integration.

## Current Status
We've identified several issues with the blog implementation:

1. **Navigation**: The blog is not accessible from the main navigation menu
2. **PayloadCMS Integration**: There are errors when connecting to the PayloadCMS backend:
   - Error in check-cms-environment.js (ES module vs CommonJS issue)
   - Fetch failures with "Headers Timeout Error" when connecting to PayloadCMS
3. **Frontend Implementation**: The blog components exist but there may be UI/UX improvements needed
4. **Error Handling**: Current fallback to mock API works but could be improved

## Tasks to Perform

### 1. Fix PayloadCMS Integration Issues
- Examine the `/payload/dadson-blog/check-cms-environment.js` file and fix the module import issue
- Update the import statement from `const http = require('http')` to use ESM syntax
- Review the PayloadCMS configuration in `/payload/dadson-blog/src/payload.config.ts`
- Fix any connectivity issues between Next.js and PayloadCMS

### 2. Add Blog to Main Navigation
- Locate the main navigation component (likely in `/src/components/layout/Navbar.tsx` or similar)
- Add a "Blog" link to the main navigation menu
- Ensure proper styling and hover effects match existing navigation links
- Link should point to `/blog`

### 3. Improve Blog Frontend Styling
- Review and enhance `BlogIndexPage.tsx` to match the site's overall design
- Ensure responsive design works on all screen sizes
- Add loading states to handle data fetching
- Improve error states with better user feedback
- Enhance the article cards with better typography, spacing, and hover effects

### 4. Enhance Error Handling
- Improve error handling in `src/lib/payload/api.ts`
- Add more detailed logging for troubleshooting
- Implement better fallback strategies when PayloadCMS is unavailable
- Add user-friendly notifications when using mock data

### 5. Add Homepage Blog Preview Section
- Create a component that displays the latest 3 blog posts
- Add this component to the homepage
- Include a "View All Posts" button linking to the blog index page

### 6. Fix Header Issues on Blog Pages
- Ensure the site header maintains consistent styling on blog pages
- Fix any background color issues that may exist

### 7. Performance Optimization
- Implement proper image optimization for blog featured images
- Add pagination to reduce initial load time
- Implement proper caching strategies for blog content

### 8. Testing
- Thoroughly test all blog functionality:
  - Navigation from homepage to blog
  - Filtering by categories
  - Viewing individual articles
  - Responsive design on mobile, tablet, and desktop
  - Fallback to mock data when PayloadCMS is unavailable

## Technical Requirements

### PayloadCMS Setup
- PayloadCMS should run on port 3004
- Next.js should properly connect to PayloadCMS using the environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYLOAD_URL`
- Fix the ES module issue in check-cms-environment.js

### API Endpoints
Ensure these endpoints function correctly:
- `/api/blog` - Returns all blog articles
- `/api/blog?slug=[slug]` - Returns a specific article
- `/api/blog?category=[category]` - Returns articles filtered by category
- `/api/blog/categories` - Returns all blog categories

### Frontend Routes
Ensure these routes render correctly:
- `/blog` - Blog index page
- `/blog/[slug]` - Individual article pages

## Implementation Guidelines
1. Use the existing code structure and styling patterns
2. Follow Tailwind CSS conventions for styling
3. Maintain type safety with proper TypeScript interfaces
4. Ensure responsive design works across all breakpoints
5. Add appropriate error handling and loading states
6. Follow Next.js best practices for data fetching and rendering
