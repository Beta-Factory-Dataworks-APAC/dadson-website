# Blog Functionality Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Resolved Redirect Loops**
   - Created a middleware.ts file to detect and break redirect loops
   - Added header tracking for redirect count
   - Implemented special handling for blog routes to prevent infinite redirects

2. **Configuration Alignment**
   - Updated payload.config.ts to use port 3001 consistently
   - Modified API_URL in src/lib/payload/api.ts to point to the correct port

3. **Fallback Mechanism**
   - Enhanced API fetch functions to fall back to mock data when PayloadCMS is unavailable
   - This ensures the blog UI works even without a running CMS backend

4. **Port Conflicts**
   - Identified and killed the process using port 3000

## Current Status

- ✅ The blog index page loads correctly without redirect loops
- ✅ The blog API endpoints are accessible (/api/blog)
- ✅ Blog content is properly displayed when using mock data
- ❌ Blog article links not detected (may need component debugging)
- ❌ PayloadCMS backend not running (MongoDB not installed)

## Next Steps for Complete Implementation

1. **Complete PayloadCMS Setup**
   - Install MongoDB: `brew install mongodb-community`
   - Start MongoDB: `brew services start mongodb-community`
   - Create database: `mongosh` → `use dadson-blog`
   - Run PayloadCMS in a separate terminal: `cd payload/dadson-blog && npm run dev`

2. **Content Management**
   - Set up admin user in PayloadCMS: `node payload/dadson-blog/create-admin.js`
   - Add blog categories and articles through the admin panel
   - Upload media files for article thumbnails

3. **Frontend Improvements**
   - Debug article links rendering in the blog index page
   - Ensure proper styling of blog cards and article pages
   - Implement category filtering functionality

## How to Maintain

1. **Always start services in this order:**
   - MongoDB: `brew services start mongodb-community`
   - PayloadCMS: `cd payload/dadson-blog && npm run dev`
   - Next.js app: `npm run dev`

2. **Environment Setup:**
   - Ensure NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYLOAD_URL points to the correct PayloadCMS URL
   - For production, update to your deployed CMS endpoint

3. **Troubleshooting:**
   - If redirect issues reoccur, check the middleware.ts file
   - For API connection issues, the fallback mechanism will use mock data
   - For component rendering issues, check the actual props being passed to components
