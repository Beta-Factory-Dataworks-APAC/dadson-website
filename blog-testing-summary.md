# Blog Functionality Testing Summary

## Testing Results

### Server Status
- Next.js server is running on port 3001 (port 3000 was already in use)
- Payload CMS appears to be accessible at http://localhost:3001/admin but doesn't show the expected admin interface

### Blog Frontend Issues
- Redirect loop errors when trying to access http://localhost:3000/blog
- Unable to access the blog frontend via Puppeteer due to these redirects

### API Issues
- The `/api/blog` endpoint returns redirect errors
- The Payload CMS API at http://localhost:3001/api/articles returns a 404 error

## Possible Causes

1. **Middleware Redirect Loop**: There may be a middleware or authentication check causing an infinite redirect loop.

2. **PayloadCMS Collection Configuration**: The blog/articles collection may not be properly configured in the PayloadCMS schema.

3. **Environment Variables**: Missing or incorrect environment variables may be causing connection issues between the frontend and CMS.

4. **Incorrect URL Configuration**: The API URL in the frontend code may be pointing to the wrong location.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Check Middleware**: Review any middleware in the Next.js application that might be causing redirect loops.

2. **Verify PayloadCMS Setup**: 
   - Confirm the articles collection is properly defined in `payload.config.ts`
   - Check that the Payload CMS server is correctly initialized

3. **Check API Routes**: 
   - Verify that the `/api/blog` route is correctly implemented
   - Ensure the connection to PayloadCMS is properly configured

4. **Review Environment Variables**:
   - Make sure `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYLOAD_URL` is set correctly in the `.env` file
   - Verify other required environment variables are present

5. **Restart Servers**:
   - Try stopping both servers and restarting them
   - Make sure PayloadCMS starts before the Next.js server

## Testing Approach

Multiple approaches were attempted to test the blog functionality:
- Standard Puppeteer navigation to blog pages
- Direct API endpoint testing
- Static HTML access with JavaScript disabled
- PayloadCMS admin interface testing

All approaches encountered redirect or connection issues, suggesting a fundamental configuration problem rather than a specific frontend or API issue.
